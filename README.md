# LeetcodeSols


My solutions for the Neetcode 150, I hope to optimize each as I move forward

Also going to throw in some interesting problems here as well, and at some point I'll include the problem numbers lol


My most proficient language is C++, but I'm going to challenge myself by using Python and learning the new methods involved there
